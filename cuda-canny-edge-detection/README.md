# CUDA Canny Filter (CUDA Runtime API Version)

## Description

This sample implements canny filter on image.

The Canny filter is a multi-stage algorithm that detects a wide range of edges in images. The algorithm involves the following steps:
1. **Noise Reduction**: Since edge detection is sensitive to noise in the image, the first step is to remove the noise in the image with a Gaussian filter.

2. **Gradient Calculation**: The smoothed image is then filtered with a Sobel kernel in both the horizontal and vertical directions to obtain the first derivative in the horizontal direction (Gx) and the vertical direction (Gy). From these two images, the edge gradient and direction can be determined.

3. **Non-maximum Suppression**: The gradient image is then quantized to one of four angles representing the direction of the gradient. The image is then scanned to remove any unwanted pixels that may not constitute the edge.

4. **Hysteresis Thresholding**: The final step is to apply a double threshold to determine potential edges. The final image is then obtained by suppressing all edges that are not connected to strong edges.

## Supported OSes

## CUDA APIs involved

### [CUDA Runtime API](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html)
cudaMalloc, cudaFree, cudaMallocHost, cudaProfilerStart, cudaEventSynchronize, cudaStreamSynchronize,

## Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 12.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.

## Build and Run

### Windows
The Windows samples are built using the Visual Studio IDE. Solution files (.sln) are provided for each supported version of Visual Studio, using the format:
```
*_vs<version>.sln - for Visual Studio <version>
```
Each individual sample has its own set of solution files in its directory:

To build/examine all the samples at once, the complete solution files should be used. To build/examine a single sample, the individual sample solution files should be used.
> **Note:** Some samples require that the Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010 or newer) be installed and that the VC++ directory paths are properly set up (**Tools > Options...**). Check DirectX Dependencies section for details."

### Linux
The Linux samples are built using makefiles. To use the makefiles, change the current directory to the sample directory you wish to build, and run make:
```
$ cd <sample_dir>
$ make
```
The samples makefiles can take advantage of certain options:
*  **TARGET_ARCH=<arch>** - cross-compile targeting a specific architecture. Allowed architectures are x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l, aarch64.
    By default, TARGET_ARCH is set to HOST_ARCH. On a x86_64 machine, not setting TARGET_ARCH is the equivalent of setting TARGET_ARCH=x86_64.<br/>
`$ make TARGET_ARCH=x86_64` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=ppc64le` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=armv7l` <br/> `$ make TARGET_ARCH=aarch64` <br/>
    See [here](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/index.html#cross-samples) for more details.
*   **dbg=1** - build with debug symbols
    ```
    $ make dbg=1
    ```
*   **SMS="A B ..."** - override the SM architectures for which the sample will be built, where `"A B ..."` is a space-delimited list of SM architectures. For example, to generate SASS for SM 50 and SM 60, use `SMS="50 60"`.
    ```
    $ make SMS="50 60"
    ```

*  **HOST_COMPILER=<host_compiler>** - override the default g++ host compiler. See the [Linux Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#system-requirements) for a list of supported host compilers.
```
    $ make HOST_COMPILER=g++
```
